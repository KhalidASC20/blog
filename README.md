# A Blog Starter App

This is a trivial blog app, started with create-react-app.

It works entirely within memory, so reloads blow everything away except for the first two mock articles.

I styled the blog website to look more visually appealing and added some cool animation to the buttons.

This repo is designed for you to fork and extend with (1) better CSS and (2) a real back end, with authentication and a database.
